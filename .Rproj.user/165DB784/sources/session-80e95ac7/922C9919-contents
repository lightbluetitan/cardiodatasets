# Introduction

The `CardioDataSets` package offers a diverse collection of datasets focused on heart and cardiovascular research. It covers topics such as *heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, aortic dissection, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical outcomes, drug effects*, and *mortality trends*.

The package is designed for researchers, clinicians, epidemiologists, and data scientists. It includes clinical, epidemiological, simulated, and real-world datasets that enable exploration of disease progression, treatment efficacy, cardiovascular risk, and patient outcomes across various populations and contexts.

This package supports the analysis and understanding of cardiovascular risk, treatment efficacy, and disease progression across various patient cohorts and clinical contexts.

## Dataset Suffixes

Each dataset in the `CardioDataSets` package uses a suffix to denote the type of R object:

`_df`: A data frame

`_tbl_df`: A tibble

`_ts`: time series

`_mtc_network`: network meta-analysis

`_matrix`: A matrix

## Example Datasets

Below are selected example datasets included in the `CardioDataSets` package:

`heartdisease_tbl_df`: Heart Disease Patients Clinical Data.

`cardioRiskFactors_df`: Cardiovascular Risk Factors.

`emotion_heartrate_df`: Study investigating how recalling anger affects heart rate.


## Data Visualization with CardioDataSets Data

###  Distribution of Age in Heart Disease Patients

```{r heart-disease-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, out.width="100%"}

# Age density plot by heart disease status and sex

ggplot(heartdisease_tbl_df, aes(x = Age, fill = HeartDisease)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  facet_wrap(~Sex, labeller = labeller(Sex = c("1" = "Male", "0" = "Female"))) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Heart Disease Status and Sex",
       x = "Age (years)",
       y = "Density",
       caption = "Data: Heart Disease Dataset") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12))

```

### Systolic Blood Pressure (sys) vs LDL Cholesterol (ldl), colored by Smoking status (smok)

```{r cardioriskfactors-plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, out.width="100%"}

# Cardio risk factors: Blood pressure - cholesterol

ggplot(cardioRiskFactors_df, aes(x = ldl, y = sys, color = factor(smok))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Systolic Blood Pressure vs LDL Cholesterol",
    x = "LDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)",
    y = "Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)",
    color = "Smoking\nStatus (0 = No, 1 = Yes)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```


### Heart Rate Change from Baseline to Anger State

```{r heartrate-anger-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, out.width="90%"}

ggplot(emotion_heartrate_df, aes(x = HR_baseline, y = HR_anger)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7, color = "#E41A1C") +  # Red points
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray40") +  # Reference line
  labs(title = "Heart Rate Change from Baseline to Anger State",
       x = "Baseline Heart Rate (bpm)",
       y = "Anger State Heart Rate (bpm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
```

## Conclusion

The `CardioDataSets` package provides a valuable and curated set of datasets for cardiovascular research. It supports advanced statistical analysis, exploratory data science, and teaching purposes by offering structured and well-documented datasets across a range of cardiovascular domains.

For more details and full documentation of each dataset, please refer to the reference manual and help files included with the package.
